## Purpose

Polar was built to help Lightning Network application developers quickly spin up one or more networks locally on their computers.

With Polar you can:

- Create a regtest Lightning Network in just a few clicks
- Connect from your app to the lightning nodes via RPC
- Add more nodes using drag & drop
- Start and stop individual nodes
- Open & Close Channels
- Create & Pay Lightning Invoices
- Launch a terminal in each bitcoin/lightning node
- View streaming logs from each node
- Manually mine new blocks
- Deposit regtest coins into each Lightning node
- Export and import networks, for sharing with other Lightning developers
- Create you own docker images to use as [custom nodes](https://github.com/jamaljsr/polar/blob/master/docs/custom-nodes.md) (ex: master branch, local fork)

Supported Network Node Versions:

- [LND](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd) - v0.15.2, v0.15.1, v0.15.0, v0.14.3, v0.13.1
- [Core Lightning](https://github.com/ElementsProject/lightning) - v0.12.0, v0.11.2, v0.10.2
- [Eclair](https://github.com/ACINQ/eclair/) - v0.7.0, v0.6.2, v0.5.0
- [Bitcoin Core](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin) - v23.0, v22.0, v0.21.1

## Dependencies

Polar requires that you have Docker installed to create the local networks

- On Mac & Windows, you can just install [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)
- On Linux, you need to install [Docker Server](https://docs.docker.com/install/#server) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) separately

You will be prompted to install Docker if Polar cannot detect it automatically

## Help Translate

Polar's translations are managed on [Crowdin](https://crowdin.com/project/polar). The initial translations of 10 languages were done by machine (Google Translate) and are likely to not be 100% accurate. If you speak multiple languages and wish to help with translations, please feel free to head over to the [project page](https://crowdin.com/project/polar) on Crowdin and submit updated strings. This assistance would be greatly appreciated.

## Development

If you would like to learn how to package Polar from source code or want to fix a bug or add a new feature, please see [CONTRIBUTING](https://github.com/jamaljsr/polar/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) for detailed instructions.
